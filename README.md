- 👋 Hi, I’m Charlie Garfield.
- 👀 I’m interested in data analysis and optimizing things, and I love just making things in general.
- 🌱 I’m currently imporving my C# and JS skills.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything, really, if you have need for someone decent at data science and statistics who knows python and java.
- 📫 You can reach me at charliejgarfield@gmail.com
- 🔎 I've also done a lot of work with the Flashpoint Project as curation-bot-guy, started back when I didn't want to get doxxed online, so be sure to check there if you're interested in other work I've done.
